# Plant_disease_Recognition

Plant Disease Recognition System using CNN with MobileNetV2 and transfer learning! 🌱📸 
This system classifies plant leaf images into categories like Healthy 🌿, Rust 🍂, and Powdery Mildew 🥀.
The goal? Early disease detection to improve crop yield and enhance plant health monitoring.

🛠️ What I did:
🔹 Implemented strong data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization. 
🔹 Visualized training metrics with Plotly and built performance dashboards.
🔹 Streamlit Web App: Upload leaf images and get instant predictions with confidence scores.

💻 Streamlit Features:
✔ Interactive performance graphs (accuracy & loss over epochs)



📊 𝑹𝒆𝒔𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒔:
Accuracy: 93.33%
Loss: 0.1285
